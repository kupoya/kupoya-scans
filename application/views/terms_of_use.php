Terms and Conditions:

Date of Last Revision: July 27, 2011

ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By using this site (the “Site” or the “Microsite”), you (“you”, the “user” or the “End User”) agree to the terms and conditions that we (“kupoya”) have provided. If you do not wish to agree to these terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”), please refrain from using the Site.


I.TERMS OF USE

1. General.

The Site provides an interactive online service operated by kupoya LTD doing business as kupoya on the World Wide Web of the Internet (the “Web”), consisting of information services, and content facilitated through kupoya, affiliates of kupoya, users (“Users”) who participate and create their own services facilitated through kupoya, or merchants (“Merchants”) offering vouchers (“Vouchers”) for social media promotion.

This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions that apply to the use of this Site by the End User. By using this Site (other than to read this Agreement for the first time), End User agrees to comply with all of the terms and conditions hereof. The right to use this Site is personal to End User and is not transferable to any other person or entity. End User shall be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of End User’s password(s), if any. End User acknowledges that, although the Internet is often a secure environment, sometimes there are interruptions in service or events that are beyond the control of kupoya, and kupoya shall not be responsible for any data lost while transmitting information on the Internet. While it is kupoya's objective to make the Site accessible 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, the Site may be unavailable from time to time for any reason including, without limitation, routine maintenance. You understand and acknowledge that due to circumstances both within and outside of the control of kupoya, access to the Site may be interrupted, suspended or terminated from time to time.



kupoya allows its End Users to request deal vouchers at Merchants that the User has identified. This request for deal Vouchers does not constitute an actual offer or deal Voucher by the identified Merchant and ONLY constitutes a request for a deal Voucher. kupoya allows users to request for a deal Voucher even though the Merchant has not approved the deal Voucher request yet. End User agrees that a request of an unapproved deal Voucher does not constitute an actual deal of said good and services provided by said Merchant identified in the deal Voucher, in return for social media promotion by the End User. ONLY until the said request is validated by kupoya’s system, a promotional content will be placed in the End User’s social media account, and a deal Voucher by the said Merchant will be provided to the End User in return. Once the said request is validated by kupoya’s system, the Merchant may not retract its approval for said deal Voucher.

kupoya shall have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Site, including, but not limited to, content, hours of availability and equipment needed for access or use. Further, kupoya may discontinue disseminating any portion of information or category of information, may change or eliminate any transmission method and may change transmission speeds or other signal characteristics.

You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract. You must be at least 18 years old to be eligible to use the Site. However, if you are at least 13 years old but not yet 18, you may use the Site in conjunction with your parent or guardian who agrees to this Agreement. No one under age 13 may use the Site.



2. Modified Terms.

kupoya reserves the right at all times to discontinue or modify any of our Terms of Use and/or our Privacy Policy as we deem necessary or desirable. Such changes may include, among other things, the adding of certain fees or charges. If kupoya makes any substantial changes, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail to the e-mail address that is registered with your account and/or by posting notice of the change on the Site. Any changes to these Terms of Use will be effective upon the earlier of our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or our posting of notice of the changes on our Site. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site. We suggest to you, therefore, that you re-read this important notice containing our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy from time to time in order that you stay informed as to any such changes. Any use of the Site by End User after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by End User of such modifications.


3. Equipment.

End User shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telephone, computer hardware and other equipment needed for access to and use of this Site and all charges related thereto. kupoya shall not be liable for any damages to the End User’s equipment resulting from the use of this Site.


4. End User Conduct.

This Site and any individual sites or merchant-specific, city-specific, or state-specific sites now or hereinafter contained within or otherwise available through external hyperlinks with our Site (the “Microsites”) are private property. All interactions on this Site and/or the Microsites must comply with these Terms of Use. Although we welcome and encourage user interaction on our Site, we do insist and require that all end users restrict any and all activity in connection with the use of this Site and the Microsites to that which involves lawful purposes only. End User shall not post or transmit through this Site any material which violates or infringes in any way upon the rights of others, or any material which is unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane or otherwise objectionable, which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any law, or which, without kupoya's express prior, written approval, contains advertising or any solicitation with respect to products or services. Any conduct by an End User that in kupoya's exclusive discretion restricts or inhibits any other End User from using or enjoying this Site and/or any of the Microsites is strictly prohibited. End User shall not use this Site or any of the Microsites to advertise or perform any commercial, religious, political or non-commercial solicitation, including, but not limited to, the solicitation of users of this Site and/or the Microsites to become users of other on- or offline services directly or indirectly competitive or potentially competitive with kupoya.

The foregoing provisions of this Section 4 apply equally to and are for the benefit of kupoya, its subsidiaries, affiliates, End Users and Merchants and its third-party content providers and licensors, and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf.

II.TERMS OF SALE

All vouchers provided in the Site or any Microsite, or any other website associated with kupoya (hereinafter “Vouchers”) are promotional vouchers that may be used in participating merchants (“Merchants”) businesses through kupoya to be used in any form such as a discount at Merchants business, a free item from the business in exchange for goods and services or without it, and/or any other form of compensation as stated in the Site or Microsite.
By applying for a Voucher from a Merchant through kupoya, you make an offer to be eligible for receiving the Voucher you have selected on the terms and conditions stated below. For more information about our collection of personal information, please view our Privacy Policy. You are required to create an account, using a social connect plugin, or without one, in order to receive any Voucher. This is required so we can share your experience via social networks that you participate in and connect with, maintain statistical information, and to ensure permissible use of the Voucher.

The Voucher you receive through kupoya is redeemable for goods or services by the Merchant only after kupoya has validated the deal that has been requested by the user. The Merchant, not kupoya, is the seller of the Voucher and the goods and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Voucher you purchase.

1. Terms and Conditions for Restaurant-Specific Vouchers.

For this section, “Restaurant” shall be defined as a Merchant who offers food and beverage for sale in its regular business operations, and is making such food and beverages available to purchasers of Vouchers.

Redemption frequency is determined by Restaurants (the “Merchant”).

Use of Restaurant-Specific Vouchers for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant and is subject to compliance with applicable law.

Vouchers cannot be combined with any other restaurant vouchers, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by Restaurant.

Any attempted redemption not consistent with these terms & conditions will render the Restaurant-Specific Voucher void.

Void to the extent prohibited by law.

All purchases of Vouchers for Restaurants may have statutory limitations on the amount of the Voucher value that can be redeemed for alcoholic beverages. For example, for customers purchasing Vouchers for Restaurants in Ohio, the redemption of the Voucher may be subject to the limitations imposed by the Ohio Revised Code Title 43 XLIII, Section 4301.01, which imposes a limitation of redeeming Vouchers at restaurants that serve both food and alcoholic and intoxicating liquor beverages, such that the redemption of such Voucher can only be applied to alcoholic and intoxicating liquor beverages for up to 30% of the value of the Voucher. Compliance with state statutes or codes (for example, the Ohio Revised Code) is the responsibility of the Merchant. kupoya’s sole role in the transaction is as a marketing agent for the Merchant Voucher, and the applicability and compliance with any relevant statute or code is solely determined and consummated by the Merchant, and kupoya has no role in such determination or action on the part of the Merchant.


2. Terms and Conditions for Non-Restaurant Merchant Vouchers

Merchant Voucher may be applied only to merchandise sold by Merchant, and may not be applied to shipping or handling charges.

Limit one (1) Voucher per redemption. Only one Voucher can be used per order unless otherwise specified by Merchant.

The issuing of credit is at the sole discretion of the Merchant unless otherwise required by law.

Neither kupoya nor the Merchant is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or Voucher’s reference number.

Voucher cannot be combined with any other vouchers, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by Merchant.

Reproduction, sale or trade of this Voucher is prohibited unless done so in compliance with applicable law.

Any attempted redemption not consistent with these terms and conditions will render the Voucher null and void.

Void to the extent prohibited by law.


3. Additional Terms and Conditions for All Vouchers received from kupoya’s Site or Microsites

All Vouchers shall be subject to the terms and conditions of kupoya and the participating Restaurant or Merchant. The Merchant or Restaurant are the sellers of the goods or services which you are purchasing once the Voucher has been approved by the Merchant.

The holder and issuer of a Restaurant-Specific Voucher is the Restaurant. The holder and issuer of a Merchant Voucher is the Merchant. As a holder and issuer of the Voucher, the Restaurant or Merchant shall be fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Restaurant or the Merchant, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed Vouchers or portions thereof. You waive, and release kupoya and its officers, directors, employees and agents from, any claim, liabilities, damages, or injury arising from or related to any act or omission of Merchant or Restaurant in connection with a Voucher or the services/goods provided in connection therewith and/or as it relates to compliance with applicable unclaimed property and other laws relating to the redemption of the Vouchers or any portion thereof. Restaurant-Specific Vouchers and Merchant Vouchers are redeemable in their entirety and on a one time basis only and may not be redeemed incrementally only after the Merchant has approved said Voucher.

the redemption expiration time is defined by the merchant as part of his campaign, unless as otherwise defined until service or goods lasts.
